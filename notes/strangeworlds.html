<h1>A review of Ray Jayawardhana's Strange New Worlds: The Search for Alien Planets and Life Beyond Our Solar System</h1>
<p>
If you wanted a splice of history and technique about discovering exoplanets read this book. Some fascinating take aways: 
<ul class="normal">
<li>Twenty years ago we knew of only one planety system, ours. </li>
<li>The Sun should last 10 billion years. A star three times its mass would run out of hydrogen twenty times sooner. </li>
<li>A Mars sized object collided with Earth to form the moon. Part of the way this is known is that the moon has much less iron than the Earth, suggesting 
it formed from Earth's crust. </li>
<li>Red dwarfs are the most common variety of star. Making up about 80% of the stars in the galaxy.</li>
<li>If a planet were more than about ten times the mass of Earth it'd accrete a large atmosphere and become a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn and have "no solid surface." </li>
</ul>  
</p>

I've thrown a couple little factoids out because they're interesting. Here is something I found really relevant and interesting: "A rocky planet would have to be at least one-third 
as massive as the Earth to enable plate tectonics. Mars falls below that threshold." I didn't know this before hand. Plate tectonics are extremely important for recycling materials on a planet. 
It stabilizes the atmosphere. Also having a nearly circular orbit is important to avoid extremes in temperatures. </p><p>
Jayawardhana mentions that Mars probably had liquid water at one point but was too small to recycle planetary carbonates. Something necessary to hold heat. He goes on to point out that an 
Earth-mass planet would be habitable at Mars' distance.

<p>
Astronomers think Super-Earths are the most common type of planet. They think this for 2 reasons. 1. Red Dwarfs are the most common type of star and their low-mass disks favor the formation of lighter planets. 
2. It should be easy to build rocky planets. As a bonus Super-Earths may be MORE habitable than Earth. Relatively thinner plates and a more active core recycles atmospheric materials faster.

A tell tale sign of life on a planet is the existence of gaseous oxygen. Oxygen is highly reactive and would be locked to other elements unless it was continuously produced. Biosignatures such as oxygen may not exist for undersea life. 
Scientists are exploring other possibilities for forms of life.
