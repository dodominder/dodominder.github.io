<h1>Notes on Descartes' Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences</h1>
<p>
Introductory philosophy courses start with Descartes for a reason. He writes to be understood. Which makes reading anything by Descartes extremely enjoyable. 
The exception here may be his book on Algebra which he had admitted to making extremely difficult so as to make sure the reader would learn something. 
I've heard that Isaac Newton could only get through a page a day before becoming stuck. I can't find whatever Algebra book this is supposed to be. 
It can't be La Géométrie and I'm not aware of anything else like it. 
</p><p> 
Anyway here are some notes jotted while reading Descartes' first published major work.
</p>
<h3>Chapter I</h3>
<p> 
"The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellences, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress..."
Reason is available to everyone. We just choose to focus on different things.
He is incredibly humble. He hopes to build up his self described "mediocre mind."
</p><p> 
Descartes laments that mathematics, which is built from a strong foundation, isn't being used to support anything loftier. 
This is in contrast to the ancient moralists whose disquisitions were built on "Foundations of sand."
</p>

<h3>Chapter II </h3>
<p> 
A camel is a horse by committee. Descartes says that things created by a single author are more effective/elegant. 
Sparta was prominent because it had a unified focus. Likewise he wants his thoughts to be this way.
</p><p> 

"It is thus quite certain that the constitution of the true religion, the ordinances of which are derived from God, must be incomparably superior to that of every other."
Nothing is beyond human grasp if we do not accept the false for the true. So doubting everything is not done for its own sake but rather to separate out the false. 
</p><p> 

Descartes traveled and conversed with everyone. He wanted to get a full range of experience. 
He waited until he was older to be sure he had gathered enough material to work with.
</p>

<h3>Chapter III </h3>
<p>
"Also, amid many opinions held in equal repute, I chose always the most moderate..."
</p><p> 

Descartes chooses the most moderate because even if it is wrong it would probably be closer to the truth than had an extreme position been taken.
</p><p> 

People are not usually aware of what they really believe. This is in part one of the reasons Descartes wants to pursue a study of himself.
</p><p> 

" Not that in this I imitated the skeptics who doubt only that they may doubt, and seek nothing beyond uncertainty itself; for, on the contrary, my design was singly to find ground of assurance, and cast aside the loose earth and sand, that I might reach the rock or the clay. In this, as appears to me, I was successful enough; for, since I endeavored to discover the falsehood or incertitude of the propositions I examined, not by feeble conjectures, but by clear and certain reasonings, I met with nothing so doubtful as not to yield some conclusion of adequate certainty, although this were merely the inference, that the matter in question contained nothing certain. "
</p><p> 

Interesting and more relevant than Descartes realizes. Far beneath the clay the Earth is a loose molten magma, unsolidified.
</p><p> 

Again, Descartes wants to doubt not for its own sake but to know what is true. What is the bedrock of truth. 
</p>


<h3>Chapter IV</h3>
<p> 

"... when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be somewhat; and as I observed that this truth, I think, therefore I am (COGITO ERGO SUM), was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the skeptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search"
</p><p> 

Yes but what is this "AM" that I am?
</p><p> 

Descartes says that he cannot doubt that he is a thinking substance, whatever this substance is. But he assumes that this substance is separate from what is material.
 "...while, on the other hand, if I had only ceased to think, although all the other objects which I had ever imagined had been in reality existent, I would have had no reason to believe that I existed; I thence concluded that I was a substance whose whole essence or nature consists only in thinking, and which, that it may exist, has need of no place, nor is dependent on any material thing; so that " I," that is to say, the mind by which I am what I am, is wholly distinct from the body, and is even more easily known than the latter, and is such, that although the latter were not, it would still continue to be all that it is."
</p><p> 

Interestingly his phrasing of the problem doesn't seem entirely wrong here. His mind could potentially exist separate from his body. Today there are people trying to transfer minds to computers. 
But the fact that something is possible doesn't infer that it is true.
</p><p> 

He goes on this path to say God must exist. The argument is in the vein of St. Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God. 
</p><p> 
Anselm's ontological argument explained from the ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA:
</p>
<p><i>
Anselm began with the concept of God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived. To think of such a being as existing only in thought and not also in reality involves a contradiction, since a being that lacks real existence is not a being than which none greater can be conceived. A yet greater being would be one with the further attribute of existence. Thus the unsurpassably perfect being must exist; otherwise it would not be unsurpassably perfect.
</i>
</p>
<p> 
I had to sit down and think through why this argument is wrong. There are many reasons. Here is one good reason why the ontological argument is wrong: 
First you make a conception of God as the greatest thing you can conceive. 
Then you assume that this concept is greater if it actually exists. 
Therefore the thing you conceived of isn't the greatest possible, so therefore God must exist.
</p><p> 

We can see how wrong this argument is if we replace God with anything else that might exist. 
Imagine a rug that's longer than any rug.
This rug is longer if it exists.
Therefore the rug actually exists.

</p><p> 

This is non-sense. Part of the problem is that the language of "Greater" isn't well defined. What does greater mean in this context?
Is god the greatest tennis player? Is God the greatest good? Is God the greatest bad? If he is not the greatest everything how should we define greatest? Define your terms. 
</p><p> 

Let's give the benefit of the doubt and gloss over whatever "greatest" is supposed to mean. In the first step, when you conceived of the greatest possible being, wouldn't you have included its existence? So since at the first step you must conclude the existence of the greatest possible being the agrument boils down to:
Step one: Assume God exists.
Step two: Therefore God exists.
</p><p> 

The argument assumes the conclusion on the first step. It's an easy mistake to make. Even in mathematics this kind of thinking creeps in. The example that comes to mind is the mathematician Fourier, whose own proof of his Fourier Series is incorrect in this way. His first step in the proof is "Assume this series can represent any function." 
Don't assume the conclusion and then run in a circle of reasoning. This kind of thinking is tautological so finding an error in the logic isn't possible. The issue is that logic doesn't always tell you what's true unless the premises are all true. 

</p><p> 

Descartes goes on to compare the certainty of the existence of God to the certainty of the sum of the interior angles of a triangle being 180 degrees. 
The irony here is that there are triangles whose interior angles sum to less than or greater than 180. 
The interior angles of a triangle only sum to 180 on the Euclidean plane. If the surface is spherical then the interior angles are always greater than 180. 
</p><p> 

Descartes invented the Cartesian coordinate system which allowed for a new type of geometry. He had hoped to settle all geometrical questions with his new tool. 
This is known as analytic geometry. Before analytic geometry there was synthetic geometry. 
</p><p> 

Now we get to the best stuff 
"For how do we know that the thoughts which occur in dreaming are false rather than those other which we experience when awake, since the former are often not less vivid and distinct than the latter? And though men of the highest genius study this question as long as they please, I do not believe that they will be able to give any reason which can be sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose the existence of God."
...
"But if we did not know that all which we possess of real and true proceeds from a Perfect and Infinite Being, however clear and distinct our ideas might be, we should have no ground on that account for the assurance that they possessed the perfection of being true."
</p><p> 

My take away from this is that <b>you can only have certainty in your beliefs if you presuppose that they are certain.</b> Fascinating. I am unsure if this is true. I have to think about it.
</p> 

<h3>Chapter V </h3>
Descartes goes into a mechanical examination of the heart and lungs. He goes on to conclude that the arrangement of the organs produce the actions of the animal. 
He points out that humans and animals have similar structures in their bodies. What makes humans more than mere mechanisms is that they can think, as demonstrated by an ability to speak. Descartes isn't talking about speaking as just making noises. He points out that magpies can say words. Language is a very different thing from just speaking. 
He gives the example that, no matter how stupid someone is, they can still produce language, which is a product of thought. No animal produces this and so animals must be pure mechanisms. 
Animals may posses the organs to speak, such as the magpie, but they lack the essence that the human possesses that produces language. 
</p><p> 

Descartes says that instincts prove that animals are destitute of reason. This is not entirely wrong. Our own instincts thwart our reasoning more often than we notice. 
</p><p> 
Human souls are immortal.
</p>
<h3>Chapter VI </h3>
<p> 

Descartes wants more investigation and experimentation in medicine. He believes it possible to cure all bodily ills. 
</p><p> 

"...  in truth, I am quite willing it should be known that the little I have hitherto learned is almost nothing in comparison with that of which I am ignorant, and to the knowledge of which I do not despair of being able to attain; for it is much the same with those who gradually discover truth in the sciences, as with those who when growing rich find less difficulty in making great acquisitions, than they formerly experienced when poor in making acquisitions of much smaller amount."
</p><p> 

"... yet-the experience I have had of possible objections to my views prevents me from anticipating any profit from them."
</p><p> 

Yes. I know the feeling. Descartes doesn't want to put forth some of his ideas because the objections will waste his time.
</p><p> 

"And further, I have never observed that any truth before unknown has been brought to light by the disputations that are practiced in the schools; for while each strives for the victory, each is much more occupied in making the best of mere verisimilitude, than in weighing the reasons on both sides of the question; and those who have been long good advocates are not afterwards on that account the better judges"
</p><p> 

This is still true today. People are more concerned with appearing to be right than in being right. 
</p><p> 



" In this respect they are like the ivy which never strives to rise above the tree that sustains it, and which frequently even returns downwards when it has reached the top; for it seems to me that they also sink, in other words, render themselves less wise than they would be if they gave up study, who, not contented with knowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, desire in addition to find in him the solution of many difficulties of which he says not a word, and never perhaps so much as thought. Their fashion of philosophizing, however, is well suited to persons whose abilities fall below mediocrity; for the obscurity of the distinctions and principles of which they make use enables them to speak of all things with as much confidence as if they really knew them, and to defend all that they say on any subject against the most subtle and skillful, without its being possible for any one to convict them of error."
</p><p> 

    YES! YES! YES!!!!! It's not included in this excerpt but he gives an analogy of a blind person draging you down into the dark to make it a fair fight. If you can't win an argument with good reasons obscure your philosophizing so no one can critique it. How often do we see this? Too often. It leaves a bitter taste in many people's mouths and they swear off of <i>philosophy</i> forever.
</p><p> 
Near the end Descartes really goes back and forth arguing with himself why he should publish this work. I'm glad he did.
