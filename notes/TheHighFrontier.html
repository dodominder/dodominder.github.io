<h1>A review of Gerard K. O'Neill's The High Frontier</h1>
<p>
This book was a lot of fun to read. Well most of it anyway. O'Neill goes through the technical aspects of colonizing space. 
Literally colonizing empty space because, unlike most authors writing today about space colonization, he wants humans to create 
gigantic rotating habitats in space. Groovy. 
</p><p>
I didn't realize until about 20 pages into the book that the author thinks colonization into space is necessary. He makes a good case and 2 
observations stick out. One: At current energy consumption growth rates, by the 2060's we'll be pumping enough energy directly into 
the atmosphere to heat it by 1 degree celsius. He called this concept the "heat limit." I've never thought about it before but the logic of it works. 
In a simplified model imagine everyone just kept buying and using refridgerators. Powering them creates excess heat and using them pumps heat out. 
Two: Population growth. Even if the rate of popultation growth is 0.1% a year that gives a doubling time of roughly 630 years!
</p><p>
The heat limit is a real concern and I'm guessing the author didn't realize we'd GO WAY PAST IT by pump carbon dioxide into the air perpetually. 
As far as overpopulation goes... Maybe pushing people into giant rotating habitats in space will help the issue but I would prefer that not to be the case. 
Living in a confined space ship may one day be the only place with elbow room but I think it would be much better to try to get the population on Earth 
under control. Scientists are calling our era the Antrhopocene because there are enough of us to change the global environment. A lot of issues stem 
from overpopulation. I've had no friends when talking about overpopultation. Everytime I bring it up at a university I hear "Every extra person has two 
hands." I mentioned this to my dad who replied "Two hands and 10 pounds of shit." The point is made. The two hands don't mean much if they aren't trained. 
I've gone off topic. Back to the review. 
</p><p>
O'Neill's writing becomes almost utopian when he talks about travel and amusements in space. Some of the possibilities are interesting, like human powered 
flight. Some of the technical aspects are out of date. I also read a follow up to this book called "The High Frontier: An Easier Way" by Al Globus and Tom Marotta 
which points out the possibilites of manufacturing smaller habitats than the one's O'Neill suggests. 
</p><p>
His proposed habitats are truely massive. The only way he sees that they could ever be built is by industrializing space. You know I just realized that 
the author of The High Frontier and its spiritual successor The High Frontier: An Easier Way both think commercializing space is necessary to fund colonization.
The authors are products of their times. O'Neill, writing in the 1970's, focuses on manufacting. Globus and Marotta focus more on tourism. If another book is written 
in this vein I expect it will focus on "Big Data" and survalence. The "industries" of the 2010's and 2020's.
</p><p>
The author may be right when he explains that housing in space won't be built until there is an industry for it. No money, no housing. 
 That is an interesting take on it. Another interesting view of the author 
is that building multiple habitats in space will allow for different forms of government in each. And the smaller populations in these habitats will allow 
for more democritization. Perhaps. Then again I think the economic realities of manufacturing would force habitats to specialize and form coallitions of habitats. 
A major concern of mine is that these habitats could be more destructive than a nuclear bomb. They could throw themselves or a meteor at Earth if they wanted. A 
small group of zealots in a space ship could do more damage than most nations. 
</p>
<p>
All in all this was a fun and thought provoking book. Some of the technical details are outdated but not many of them. I prefer the grander visions of the 1970's. 
The main thing that annoyed me, that I absolutely despised was the "letters." Throughout the book there are "letters" from people living in habitats writing home. 
They are unbearably boring. I read the first couple but skipped the rest.
