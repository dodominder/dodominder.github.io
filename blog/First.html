<h1>First!</h1>
<p>
This is the first entry of this blog so I assume it will never be read. Like a message in a bottle this blog may be found by some lone traveler. Which is as it should be since this blog was in part inspired by a blog I found a few years ago by accident.
</p><p>
While searching google for something random I came across a blogger.com blog from a woman. She was in her late 30’s or early 40’s and had started the blog after being diagnosed with a terminal cancer. I can’t remember what type of cancer and it doesn’t really matter. What stuck with me was that the blog was only active for a few months, maybe half a year.
</p><p>
Vaguely I can remember the line “That’s it. Goodbye.” in the last entry. How sad. The blog itself felt like a message in a bottle thrown from a lost island. This woman had existed and then, knowing the end was near, left a note for anybody who happened to see it. The existence of the blog itself spoke to me. I wish I could find it again or remember the name of the author. My bookmarks have vanished over the years.
</p><p>
Still it makes me wonder how many things are echos of voices that no longer speak? When you see “Joe loves Tina” scratched into a tree in the park doesn’t it make you wonder ‘what ever happened to Joe and Tina’? It makes me wonder. These mementos we leave, for whom do we leave them? To write your name in wet concrete insures that someone will see your name after you are dead. And I don’t know why I or anyone else likes leaving these mementos. All the foot prints we leave in the sand get washed away by the tide. Yet we still turn around to look at the trail of prints we left.
</p><p>
The woman’s blog had an effect on me that I hope to have on others. To be found by accident and leave the finder with a greater sense of wonder. The blog left me with a sense of wonder because there laid so much more to it then was left on the screen. Behind the words was a vulnerable person trying to reach out one more time.
</p><p>
What is that like? To know you are going to die very soon and not be in denial. To peacefully fall into the eternal sleep. I imagine that, if you are not in denial, it will be a gyre of calmness and dread. Calmness when the bills, the pettiness of everyday life, the weather don’t matter. Dread for all the things left to do that time has cut short.
</p><p>
We’re all slowly dying. So what does it matter if death comes in 10 days or 10,000? Well, I know that to some extent the person you will be in 10,000 days is not the person that you are now. The further away your own death is, the more it can seem like the death of a stranger. Knowing that we cannot out run death makes us aware, at least in some abstract way, that “I am going to die.” So what does it feel like really, when the abstraction turns concrete?
</p><p>
Many people that I’ve talked to about death insist that thinking about it is unpleasant. Or worse still, they are superstitious enough to think that thinking about death will hasten its arrival. I think both reactions are full of fear. I don’t know what the author of the blog thought about death really. Did she think she’d open her eyes in heaven or go off into eternal nothingness? Who knows.
</p><p>
Does it not make you wonder, not only what will you leave behind for some stranger to wonder about, but about what in general will the human species leave behind? And for who? Nobody? Our descendant species? Something else? Who knows?
</p><p>
The most probable answer is inconceivable. Would the Pharaohs of Egypt comprehended what their tombs meant to visitors at the Museum of Natural history? Probably not. And I can’t think of anyone off hand more obsessed with their after-death-mementos.
</p><p>
Her short blog made me think and wonder. The endearing vulnerability of someone who can write out their last words for strangers to find is someone worth remembering.
