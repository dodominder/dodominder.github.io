<h1>All is (n)umber</h1>
<p>
Mention that you study math to a stranger and you’ll hear the old “Math is the language of the universe” quip. The statement is true enough. It’s a sentiment, an idiom, not something to be taken literally. So why look any deeper into the thought? Well, it is an interesting and very old thing to think about.
</p><p>
The idea that the universe boils down to anything is fascinating. You could say everything is made from a single thread weaved over itself or that the universe is pure “will and representation”, and on and on with ideas like that. The contender for the universal element I’m considering today is math. Mostly because I can’t make up my mind about it.
</p><p>
I remember hearing a guy ask his son “What does every living thing feel?” and the kid said “Love.” I could hear the annoyance in his dad’s voice when he replied “No. Pain.” This little exchange was like a hammer blow and knocked out any conception of the universe as being a place of love or joy. Or in any case being a place where love and joy were available to every living thing.
</p><p>
This exchange illustrates to me that it may be easy to counter a nice sentiment with a stark reality. I haven’t thought of a quip to counter the sentiment that the universe is mathematical. Maybe because I partly believe it to be so. But why do I believe it? Like most people, I just believe what I want to be true.
</p><p>
It is too easy to believe something only because we want it to be true. Most people think that they’re smarter, better looking, and funnier than the average person. Which of course is impossible. People think they are loved because they want to be loved. They think they’ll win the lottery because they want to win. This misguided thinking also appears in a negative way. The person who thinks the worst will happen because they don’t want it to happen is falling into the same trap.
</p><p>
The point is that when asking oneself if the universe was written in mathematics you must ask yourself “Do I believe X because I want X to be true? Do I not believe X because I don’t want it to be true?” The goal then is to try to reason without asking what you want.
</p><p>
I’ve asked almost all of the professional mathematicians that I’ve met the question “Is the universe completely mathematical.” Though my question could be better phrased it is usually understood well enough to get a coherent response. You’d think people closest to the subject would give the best responses. But pretty much each mathematician gives a list of examples where math describes the universe. This is not enough. I want good reasons.
</p><p>
A chair can be described as “being made of wood and having four legs.” This does not mean I can now offer a description as the thing itself. A description of a chair is not a chair and a mathematical description of a chair is not a chair. The fact that so much of the world is described mathematically is a necessary but not sufficient condition to concluded that the universe is purely mathematical.
</p><p>
Supposing that everything is mathematical is a perennial idea. That “all is number”, as a Pythagorean occultist would say, or that the letters in which the universe is written are circles, triangles, and other similar figures, as Galileo characteristically said is appealing. The coherent universe offered by these sentiments is the source of their eloquence. Still I refuse to believe something only because it offers order and I like things to be in order.
</p><p>
The three most common reasons that I’ve read against the universe being purely mathematical are:
</p><p>
1. Mathematics only exists in our minds because we’re human and other beings could conceive of mathematics differently or not at all.
<br />
2. Scientists and engineers use approximations in their work.
<br />
3. The universe and people are chaotic.
</p><p>
I’ll answer these objections in order.
</p><p>
1. A fair point. Different beings may have different conceptions. But it is irrelevant how or whether a being conceives of math. Whether or not an alien or super advanced A.I. conceives of 3 rocks + 2 rocks equals 5 rocks the way we do it’ll still have to deal with the fact that it is. The conception of unities shouldn’t negate their properties.
<br />
2. An example of this is an electrical engineer who uses an approximation, like Ohm’s law, to design a circuit. To this I say, just because an idea becomes more complicated doesn’t mean it’s less mathematical. It just tells me that aggregates are simpler to deal with.
<br />
3. The universe and people are chaotic but that doesn’t mean chaos isn’t mathematical. Just because you can’t create an equation that predicts the weather or someone’s mood doesn’t mean these things aren’t under the rule of mathematics. Which makes one wonder if the universe is made from one logistic mapping [see the addendum for a divergent but interesting point about this].
</p><p>
My own view is somewhat platonic. Plato saw the world we know as the shadow of perfect forms. But can I invert that a bit and ask: Is the mathematically perfect world but the shadow of an imperfect world? Take the moon for example. I’m so far away that it looks perfectly round but we all know it’s cratered. Might the mathematically perfect systems that we create work so well, describe so much, because if we just squint our eyes the universe really is mathematical.
</p><p>
It makes one wonder if math itself is a macroscopic property of the universe, like heat. It is meaningless to say that the temperature of a single atom in an infinite empty void is 65 °F but once we start collecting groups of atoms in a room we can talk about temperature. My point is that aggregates behave differently from their constituent parts. And in aggregates we definitely observe a mathematical universe.
</p><p>
What would a universe that wasn’t only mathematical look like? Well, it could look like the one we currently exist in, couldn’t it? What about a universe devoid of any mathematical truth? I have no idea. So I can narrow down the possibilities so that we live in either a universe of pure mathematical forms or partial. I can not decide one way or the other.
</p><p>
This has nothing to do with the main question being asked here but I have to mention it. My cousin is constantly telling me that we live in a computer simulation. I always say "maybe" but I don't really care. He's usually parroting a popular version of Nick Bostrom's simulation argument. I don't like Bostrom's arguments because they seems so limited. We could be in a simulation but why bother saying that it's an ancestor simulation? Couldn't we just as well be the byproduct of a simulation of something else? If our universe is described by a logistic mapping or some fractal's edge isn't that just as likely to be simulated as anything else, why assume you are the center of attention? If I had to follow Bostrom's arguments then I would place my bet that there's a greater than 1/3 chance that our universe is purely mathematical. Because he reasons that there is a 1/3 chance that it is simulated. And I feel comfortable saying that a simulation that runs perfectly doesn't have to worry about its substrate. Hence it would be perfectly mathematical.
