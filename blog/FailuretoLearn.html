<h1>Failure to Learn</h1>
<p>
I tried recording a podcast and it was a horrible rambling mess. That is to be expected. To do something well you have to do it badly. Anything worth doing is worth doing badly the first time you try. So I've learned to keep trying. A lesson I wish I had learned much sooner. A Niels Bohr quote comes to mind: An expert is a person who has found out by his own painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field.1 My take away from this was to make a bunch of mistakes. And hide them if you want to look extra cool.

Variety and quantity appear to be the name of the game in podcasting. Which makes me feel confident that I might attract listeners. I suspect my listeners to be mostly people wanting to argue or amend what I say. I've learned not to engage in that stuff online. It's an bottomless pit. I must also admit that I've put off making a podcast for a long time because of my fear of becoming famous. A fear that my friends assure me is insane. Still, I've had a taste of fame and it is bitter.

Podcasting just seems like a lot of fun and I love listening to those interviews Sam Harris does with all those super smart people. I was also a fan of the Partially Examined Life podcast. The quality of that podcast went down after adding the fourth host. All the hosts are fine. There are just too many people trying to get their thoughts out who are also trying to be pleasant to each other. Sometimes you need to rant, or mouth off, or extend a very long thought to get anywhere. My podcast is a poor imitation of the ones I like. I like having someone in my ear speaking to me about their train of thought. Especially when its novel.

My podcast is bad but I can't let that stop me. It hasn't stopped me from continuing to write this blog, which might be getting better each week? The pain of being bad at something is only being intensified by the ever more miraculous abilities of people all over the world. Producing something relatively good or even mediocre is import. Small successes build on each other. The bar for what's good is constantly being raised. Who cares if you learned to play a four chord song on the guitar when there's an army of musical prodigies on youtube? I've got nothing against people with talent. I'm just saying its not helpful to constantly compare yourself to others. Our measuring sticks are fucked up.

A good comparison of the importance of failing is the difference between self taught computer programmers and mathematicians. How many didactic-mathematicians are there? Trust me, they exist, Ramanujan comes to mind, but their numbers are weak. Now look at the legion of self taught computer programers. Many of whom are as good or better than someone who has studied how to program at school. Why the dearth of competent self-taught mathematicians compared to the self taught developer? Both skills require a lot of abstraction, algorithmic thinking, intense focus, etc... The difference appears to me to be the immediate feedback of the computer. When you mess up the computer tells you immediately and you are forced to fix your error. That kind of instant feed back is super useful.
