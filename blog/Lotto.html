<h1>Lotto</h1>

I think I've stumbled across a method of stopping a bad habit before it begins. The method: Watch how stupid it is when someone else does it. I know that sounds obvious but seeing something unfold in person is much more cogent than just thinking about it. This method took me years to come to. I may not be the smartest person but I think you don't need to be smart to be right. And this method seems to be serving me well so far.

This whole thing begins with Ayn Rand. In high school I had friends who liked her so I got into her books as well. Her didactic fiction is painful to read. I got to the point of just reading two pages a day of Atlas Shrugged to finish it. After reading all of her work I had indoctrinated myself as an objectivist. I no longer am one and kind of consider the whole philosophy a joke. The thing that snapped me out of it was meeting other objectivists and libertarians. I couldn't reason my way out of it. I had to feel its stupidity in person.
</p><p>
Meeting people who held the exact same view points snapped me out of my views. Hearing other people say these absurd things made me rethink what I believed. It made me see how absurd my own thinking was. One of the hurdles of 'snapping out of' an ideology is that we believe confrontation with opposing beliefs will challenge us to reshape our own. That doesn't work. I can say from personal experience that when a libertarian argues with a socialist both come away more strident in their beliefs.
</p><p>
Try to have some sympathy for those of us who are or were ideologically possessed. And do not prevent people of like minds from meeting. Allowing them to meet will most likely cause internal conflicts among the idea's adherents. This obviously doesn't always work. There are still many who succumb to ideological possession and double down upon meeting fellow believers! Still, for many people who are mostly rational this is a nice way that may break down what they believe.

This is not an essay on breaking out of ideological possession. There's no fool proof formula for that. I just wanted to give my own history and observance of what I saw happening to my thinking. At a libertarian meeting there was a man advocating the complete abolishment of public schools. This is something you can readily argue for from libertarian principles. I heard someone ask "Well what about people too poor to afford school? How'll they learn to read and write." This man, and I'm not joking, went on to explain that his parents had sent him to a private school and that everyone's parents could do the same.
</p><p>
That kind of divorcement from REALITY made me reconsider a lot of the ideological possession I had. Basically he was advocating the old 'might makes right' argument but replacing might with wealth. I have much to say about systems of ethics and the stupidity of rigid axiomatic systems of ethics. Too much to mention here. To the point - this blatant stupidity didn't make me think so much as it made me feel disgust. So if you're considering doing something. Watch for yourself the people who do it and consider then whether or not its a good idea.

Recently I was thinking about playing the lottery. I have some chronic gamblers in the family and think gambling is abhorrent. To break myself from any desire to play I stopped imagining how I'd spend 30 million dollars. Then while buying some candy I stuck around and watched the people who bought lottery tickets. They disproportionately bought cigarettes compared to the average costumer. Not a sign of rational decision making. Besides that though I wasn't convinced any one of those people playing would win. People who may be much more deserving of the money than I, so why should I play? What would make me so special? Nothing. So I can't bring myself to waste money on the lottery.
