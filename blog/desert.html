<h1>If you’re stuck in the middle of the desert and can’t find your dream job it’s your fault</h1>
<p>

A lot of people have been stuck in your position. Stranded thousands of miles from home. Chasing every mirage. Running from snakes in the middle of a scorching desert. These people may blame the 100 °F weather or total lack of food, water, or shelter for their inability to land their dream job. Yet the truth is they’re just not trying hard enough.
</p><p>
Spending every weekend of the last 18 months sending out your resume isn’t enough. Neither is being dressed to the nine for every interview. It is a necessary part of landing your dream job but definitely not enough. Instead of spending just 16 hours each weekend applying to jobs, you should also be spending 12 hours each day.
</p><p>
Look, there are 24 hours in a day. You can afford to spend at least half of each day looking for a job. And don’t waste my time with an excuse like “I’m stuck in the Chihuahuan desert, I have more important things to do than look for any job.” If I were you I’d spend every night lifting every flat rock in the basins between the mountains. But “oh,” I hear you complain, “the only thing under a rock is a snake.” Exactly! God put those snakes there so you could start networking.
</p><p>
Most of your problems stem from your lack of imagination. You are surrounded with job opportunities in the middle of an empty desert. Even if there are no people to interact with there are still plenty of coyotes and road runners. Your lack of imagination and work ethic is holding you back.
</p><p>
First you need to address the real problem. Your next move should be to find a very smooth flat rock. Polish the rock until you can see your dim reflection in it. Then you’ll realize the real reason that you still haven’t landed your dream job is you!
</p><p>
It’s easy, too easy, to blame your geography. I used to be like that too. I grew up in Midtown Manhattan. And after a grueling six day job search I was finally hired by my uncle’s advisory firm. Honestly I almost gave up. By the third day I was pretty much spent. Ready to throw in the towel and work for one of my cousin’s startups. But I knew I had to follow my dreams. So I mustered up the energy to call my uncle. The rest followed naturally.
</p><p>
Accepting that if you never stop trying you’ll eventually succeed is the next step. Instead of hiding from the sun in the middle of the day you should be stalking your potential employers online. Trying to find an angle to appeal to them. Say you notice that the C.F.O. of a company that you want to work for likes to golf. You should get a membership at the same golf course or get a job as a caddy and follow him around.
</p><p>
The real key here with a scheme like this is faking authenticity. Authentically faking authenticity takes work. If you’re not ready to put in the work then just give up now. What you consider “uncompromising” I consider “lazy.” Don’t be lazy. Learn to fake it until you make it.
</p><p>
Follow my advice and within the next six days you too will land your dream job. Guaranteed!
