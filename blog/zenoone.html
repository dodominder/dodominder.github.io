<h1>A non-mathematical solution to Zeno's paradox of motion </h1>
<p>
  Most people are first exposed to Zeno's paradox of motion through an introductory philosophy or calculus class. As it was first told to me: "If I walk across the room to the door, before I get to the door I must walk halfway there. But before I get halfway there I must get halfway to the halfway, and before that, etcetera. So therefore I can never reach the door." This is usually posed as a toy problem to think about. After some time it's revealed that you can sum an infinitely tiny series. Voilà. You can just add infinite tiny pieces to get a definite length. This solution disappoints me. I've read it in a memoir of a physicist whose name I can't remember at the moment.
Why does it matter if you can sum tiny pieces? The idea that you have to traverse halfway then halfway then another halfway ad nauseam lends itself to a sum. You can easily sum a geometric series to some definite value. This isn't true for every series you could conceive of. If asked to walk half of the way to the door. Then walk one third of the way, then one fourth of the way, then one fifth of the way, the argument breaks down. One half plus one third plus one fourth plus... (etcetera) is the harmonic series. You could say that the harmonic series reaches the door at some point since the series is unbounded but I want to get to stop at the door, not blow by it. The geometric series always you to start at an arbitrary distance from the door. I don't believe the harmonic series allows this.

Instead of using math to make the argument I believe you can just cut the gordian knot! Let's break down the statements of this paradox of motion. This is the way I've heard it which is not one of Zeno's formulations.

</p><p>

(1) The door is X feet away.<br />

(2) Before getting to the door I am always walking half the distance I intend.<br />

(3) Therefore I never get there since I am always walking halfway there.<br />

I must digress for a second to make reference to Aristotle's Physics (part 9):


<blockquote>
Zeno's reasoning, however, is fallacious, when he says that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless. This is false, for time is not composed of indivisible moments any more than any other magnitude is composed of indivisibles.
</blockquote>
</p><p>
Aristotle's acknowledgement that time is not composed of indivisible moments was prescient. I have heard that if space-time is discrete it's minimal unit is smaller than the planck length. I am not a physicist and cannot dispute this claim but from what I understand this conclusion was derived empirically. Space may be discrete but it may not be. My own suspicion is that it is continuous but that is only because I was told that the planck length is the smallest possible length. Is that true? I don't know.


</p><p>
This diversion has a point. If Zeno thought of space or time as being made up of discrete units then why would he make arguments about the infinitesimally small? Unless he was making some other point and using his own paradoxes of motion to highlight some other absurdity? That is a possibility but I am not a scholar on ancient greek philosophy. I'm just a guy who thinks the paradox as it is presented in calculus classes is bad.


</p><p>
What bugs me so much about the formulation is that it can be phrased in a contradictory way from the start. If I can walk half way to the door then I can walk the other halfway to get there. It doesn't matter if I must first traverse half of the remaining half. If it is proposed that I can walk the first half, or any half, then I can just keep taking those steps until I reach the door.

  I write about this again. This <a href="Zeno.html">version</a> is slightly better than this page but not by much.
