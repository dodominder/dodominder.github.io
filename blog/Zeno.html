<h1>Zeno’s Hopscotch</h1>
<p>
In most calculus 1 courses the teacher begins the class with some version of one of Zeno’s paradoxes of motion. The paradoxes of motion as typically presented always bothered me. The one I learned in my calculus class went like this:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
The teacher put his back against the wall and said “I want to walk to the door. Before I get to the door I must walk halfway there.” The teacher walked halfway there. Then he said “Now I have halfway to go. But before I can walk the remaining distance I must walk half of that halfway.” He stepped forward by a quarter of the full length. Then he said “Again, before I walk this quarter I must walk halfway. And so on.”
</blockquote>
</p><p>
The point was that you get stuck in an infinite regress of smaller steps and therefore you never really move. This version of the paradox is supposed to prove that reaching any distance is impossible and then the calculus teacher is supposed to show that you can sum infinitely tiny steps to get a perfect approximation of the distance. I say “supposed to” because I think the typical way the paradox is presented is wrong and the solution is wrong.
</p><p>
The problem with saying “Before I get to the door I must walk halfway there” is that you’ve already assumed that you can walk halfway there! You can’t assume the conclusion of your argument. Zeno’s original arguments are more subtly put. So this is not a critique of the original arguments so much as an argument for the rephrasing of the two versions commonly stated. The two versions are:
</p><p>
1. To walk any distance I must first walk half that distance. And to reach half that distance I must walk a quarter of the distance. And before reaching a quarter of the distance I must reach an eight of the distance, so on and so forth, so I never really move.
<br />
2. To walk any distance I must first walk half of that distance. Then I must walk the remaining half, but to finish this remaining half I must first finish a quarter of it, but to finish this quarter I must first pass half of the quarter, and so on. So I never truly reach my destination.
</p><p>
The problem with version 1 is that you assume from the start that you aren’t going to move. The question is How Big is that first step? You never take it so you never move. The problem with version 2 is that you assume that you can walk halfway there. Well, if you can walk halfway there then you can walk another half.
</p><p>
Supposedly these problems get cleared up with in calculus 2. Where students learn to sum infinite series. This bothers me because you can only sum certain infinite series to definite values. You can sum 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + … It is what is known as a geometric series. Its sum will equal the distance that it was set out to equal. Okay, so if Zeno takes half steps, infinitely, he will get to where he’s going since the sum does have a definite value. But what if Zeno doesn’t take half steps?
</p><p>
There are sequences of steps that Zeno can take that sum to infinity, so Zeno will pass his destination or land right on it. Zeno could also take a sequence of steps that are infinite but that don’t sum to the full length that he wanted to walk. For example if Zeno walked in steps 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, 1/120…, he would only reach about 72% of the distance he wanted to go.
</p><p>
My point with these other examples of possible sequences is that the arguments for or against Zeno’s paradox shouldn’t rest on whether an infinite series sums. The sequence of steps such that Zeno only reaches 72% of the distance seem just as valid as the one when he blows past his distance or lands right on it.
</p><p>
In defense of my calculus teachers I have to point out that they’re not teaching philosophy and that they are not trying to resolve the paradoxes of motion. The arguments are brought up to get the mind working. I’m not sure how to rephrase the arguments such that we can claim calculus answers them. But I do think they should be better phrased.
</p><p>
I really haven’t thought about refuting Zeno’s original arguments. I’m just reflecting on what felt like unreflective answers from calculus classes. Zeno’s paradoxes are fun to think about and they lead to bigger questions that I don’t know how to think about. For instance, what does it mean to move further away from something? When I walk away from someone I’m putting something called distance between us right? But is distance fine grained? Infinite divisible? Relative?
</p><p>
I say relative because I live on the surface of a sphere and as I walk away from something I also walk towards it. If distance can be said to be a grand circle created by two points on a sphere then the total distance is always the same no matter where the two points are. You could avoid this by defining distance as a segment of the grand circle. Or by defining the distance between two points as a line that goes straight through the sphere. Still, it has to make one wonder if putting distance between two things is relative to the framework conceived.
</p><p>
What if everything that exists is on the surface of something like a sphere in a higher dimension (a hyper sphere), and the “grand circles” (geodesics) that connect any two points are all the same length. Then in a similar manner it would be difficult to say that the total distance between two points is ever changed. It depends on what is possible in terms of motion. What are the rules of the game?
</p><p>
One has to wonder whether Zeno played hopscotch as a kid. Where you can only move in discrete steps. Why did he hinge his arguments on space being continuous? A game like hopscotch or checkers shows that within a set of rules “motion” and distance are discrete. Is this the case for our world? What are the rules of the game?
