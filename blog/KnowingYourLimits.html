<h1>Knowing Your Limits</h1>
<p>
Everything is limited. The sun will eventually burn out. My mailbox will rust. The server this page is hosted on will eventually turn off for a final time. Knowing my own limits has been difficult. Paradoxically it seems that you can only know your limits by exceeding them, if only just a little bit. I was curious about how much I could possibly store in my head. It turns out, not that much. After gorging myself on a broad and deep information diet I have not been able to keep more than maybe 15% of what I had attained.
</p><p>
It's tempting to blame this only on memory but I'm not entirely convinced it is just a failure of memory input and output. It is starting to seem that each new thought or 'process' going on in my brain changes its physical structure in some subtle way. I'm willing to go out on a limb here for the sake of thinking and ask do my thoughts, conscious and unconscious, each have a specific physical 'state' in the brain. Could thoughts be mapped bijectively to physical states? I don't see why not. That may turn out not to be the case. I don't know.
</p><p>
If it is the case that each state of mind has a unique physical state, then doesn't the converse have to be true as well? That each unique physical state of the nervous system produces a unique state of mind? And if this is the case then what constitutes my mind is perpetually changing. It can't physically stop changing. The mind even changes itself. How strange. What I'm getting at is that my mind is not only limited in its capacity because of its size. It is also limited in that each new physical change produces a new mind, even if only slightly altered. Each new thing I learn, if I learn it properly and well, changes all the previous things I had some inkling of, even if the change is tiny. 
</p><p>
All of that previous hypothesizing may be wrong. I don't have any training in psychology, anatomy, or biology. Still I have learned that my mind has limits in its willingness to "pick things up." With all limits it appears best to accept them and work around them. The limits of everything about oneself must be accepted if you want to actually do anything. If you want to run a marathon and weigh 500 pounds not knowing your limits will kill you. If you want to attempt a faustian bargain and "know everything," you will become ignorant and useless. No one can be a nuclear physicist, a ballerina, and a diplomat all at the same time.
</p><p>
I am guilty of wanting to take the faustian bargain. And there are many websites and places that are willing to oblige. Lose 30 pounds in 30 days! Learn Spanish in 1 week! Learn how to run a business with this simple web course! Spare me. None of these types of products have respect for the limits of human beings. Reflecting on your own limits really clears things up. It actually allows you to pick something worth reaching for.
</p><p>
Still it is too easy to fall back on fantasies of "doing it all." I have acknowledged some of my limits and acknowledged that I always forget them. Working myself too hard. Refusing sleep. Spending more than I earn. Eating too much. Not exercising. Pure will power has never helped me sort these things out. I have found that I have to basically trick myself into doing things properly. I have to leave my sneakers in a locked gym locker. This forces me to always return for them. I have to leave my credit card in a block of ice to be absolutely sure I get out of the habit of using it so carelessly.
</p><p>
This way of thinking I believe lowers stress. Acknowledging that you are a limited being. That your lifespan is limited. Your abilities are like a wheel barrel that can only carry so much weight before the tire goes flat. Observing and living within your limits and maybe even pushing them once in a while to expand them. I have noticed stress emanating from my fingertips when I or someone else pushes me beyond the things of which I am capable. Some of this is good, too much is bad and defeats the purpose. 
</p><p>
How am I to know my limits and expand them? To know them. Push yourself until something hurts. To see how much you can write, write until your wrist hurts. To see how many pushups you can do, do them until you can't. To push these limits it is clear that you should work in accordance with your limits until an opportunity presents itself for you to push further. Then push further.
