<h1>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics?</h1>
<p>
"The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics."
</p>
<p>
I've heard that phrase over and over again in reference to how mathematics can be used to illuminate and describe the world. The phrase was coined by physicist Eugene Wigner in the 1960s. It is true that mathematics does describe many parts of the world very well. Math also anticipates some discoveries to be made by geneticists, physicists, etc... Impressive as all that is I am unconvinced that our universe is inherently mathematical. That once we reach down to the bedrock of reality it can all be built up again with math.
</p>
<p>

The phrase may not be dealing with the question directly. I am only writing about it because I've heard the phrase applied in this way. It may be the case that our reality are the mathematical thoughts of god but I remain unconvinced. I think the impulse to ascribe the behavior of larger phenomenon to its component parts is to blame. What I mean by that last sentence is that a house may have a chimney but the bricks of the house do not each have a chimney.
</p>
<p>

People will tend to assume that the things that are true for a large object will hold for each piece of the object. This is not a logical necessity. This was the error in thought that caused 20th century physics to be so mindblowing. It was assumed that the behavior of matter at the macro-level would scale down to the micro-level. We all know now that it doesn't. This mistake in thought is understandable. But I believe it is also what leads one to believe that reality is, at bedrock, mathematical.
</p>
<p>

I am agnostic on the question. I really don't know either way. It is entirely conceivable to me that mathematics is an emergent phenomenon from some baser principals. If that is the case what happens if I learn to describe these baser principals in mathematics? Well, in my conception of this idea the principals beneath math can't be described by math without a contradiction or through a long chain of circular reasoning.
</p>
<p>
When I learned calculus I lost my faith that reality is inherently mathematical at bedrock. Calculus uses infinitely increasing approximations to find say, the area of a circle. Isn't the circle itself just the perfect approximation of circles we construct? There is no good argument that reality isn't mathematical. There are too many things that pop out of purely theoretic concerns.
</p>
<p>
This is the reasoning I encounter about this topic "Almost everything we observe and know about can be described mathematically. Therefore the underlying causes are mathematical." I accept the first sentence but I believe the second sentence is a non sequitur. What would convince me to take either side? I don't know. If you could reach bedrock in our physical universe, true bedrock, and show that it is some fixed point on a manifold then I'd be agreeable to the idea.
</p>
<p>

My concern is sort of like this and I may be completely misguided. Imagine you're standing on a chair 1 mile in the sky. Under the chair you're standing on is another one, under that chair, another one. From what you can tell it's chairs all the way down. You can't see the bottom chair. It may be a chair but it could be a sofa or table. Something that you can sit on that isn't a chair.

  I write about this again. This <a href="AllIsNumber.html">version</a> is slightly better than this page but not by much.
