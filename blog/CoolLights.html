<h1>Cool Lights</h1>

After replacing a burnt out incandescent in my bathroom with an LED I’ve become fanatical about them. They’re just better than the incandescent and compact fluorescent.
<br /><br />
The bulb in the picture had been on for an hour and was still cool enough to touch (the bulb was, I didn’t touch the ballast). Are all LEDs like this? No, but they all should be cooler than their incandescent counterpart. The energy efficiency of these things comes from not wasting energy on heat. Unless you’re using the bulbs to hatch eggs or in an easy bake oven the LEDs should render them completely obsolete.
<br /><br />
The only place in a typical household were the old incandescent was still the best option was in a closet or attic. The compact fluorescent (CFL) takes time to “warm up” to its full brightness and is more sensitive to the stress of being turned on and off. For use in a closet where you’ll just be flicking the light on and looking around for a few seconds the incandescent will last longer.
<br /><br />
When considering which bulb is better overall for the environment it’s not enough to consider which uses less energy. It’s also about the materials used and the proportion of toxic chemicals released. Consider two equivalent bulbs, one CFL and one incandescent, for which the production of the CFL releases, say a quarter, of the mercury into the environment that the incandescent does but the CFL must be replaced five times as often for a given use. For whatever this use is would be a case where the incandescent is the eco-friendly option.
<br /><br />
This now all seems like a mute point though because these LEDs cost about as much as a CFL or incandescent at Home Depot, last longer, and use less energy. I do have to mention one downside that I’ve run into.
<br /><br />
Two small light bulbs. One led and one incandescent.
I have three G8 lights in my kitchen which use 20 watt bulbs. The LED replacements are a hair too thick for the socket. Everything fits and works nicely but I can’t fit the glass cover that goes over the bulb because the tip of the LED replacement is a few millimeters thicker. I was also surprised to find they were hot to the touch. Nowhere near as hot as the old bulb but still warmer than expected. This is probably because the ballast is so close to everything else. These replacements are 2 watts, so with a little bit of math that’s 3 bulbs times (20-2) = 54 Watts saved. The average kWh price of electricity is 12 cents and these lights run for 7 hours a day, on average, so that’s 365*7*0.054*0.12 which roughly equals $16.56 saved each year.
<br /><br />
That’s money saved just from using less electricity and doesn’t factor in not having to replace the LEDs as often as their counter parts.
