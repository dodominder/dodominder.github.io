<h1>Falling in Love with the Rain</h1>
<p>
If there was anything created by God it must have been the rain. There is a divinity in cold rainy nights. When clouds give that low rumble while rain thumbs the roof.

</p><p>

I felt it out there on the grass. A melancholic soul lying facedown on a cold grown. Back tortured by endless rain. Haven't you felt it? That stir in the clouds that can be heard in between those pittering rain drops?
</p><p>



Rain comes with a rhythm that soothes life to sleep. Every creature scurries to its burrow to avoid that brisk beauty. Let it wake you up. Let it make you feel young.

Years ago a thunderstorm came while I was at work. That happen often enough and I wish I could remember all those hours spent waiting out the storm. The storm was so bad, this time, that I was sent home. Wearing a collared short and shorts I ran about a mile to my car. Soaked from head to toe. Lighting hit struck nearby, a transformer was on fire. The fire was white.
</p><p>



The boom that followed sped my shoes and I made it to the car. The rain had woken me up. Muddy floor on the car. A cheap car. Paint constantly peeling off. I digress.

Learn to love the rain.
