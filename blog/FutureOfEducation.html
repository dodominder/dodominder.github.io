<h1>The Future of Education Is Not on a Screen</h1>

<p>
    As of March of 2020 most of the schools across America have been closed. My own college closed and I had to accept my degree through a slide show presentation. 
    This is all understandable, all for the best. The schools closed their physical doors but opened what is being touted as the Future of Education. 
</p><p> 
    With more than 1.9 million education jobs to be cut through this year and the next it seems evident that this is just the way we do things now. 
    For anyone interested in actually learning this is a complete disaster. Human minds aren't like hard-drives, with unformatted empty space. 
    Our brains are as physical as our bodies. Neither exists in a virtual realm. 

</p><p> 
    Students don't pay attention to the video lessons because they'd rather watch YouTube or mindlessly scroll Facebook. Teachers will be forced to take on more students as the school districts realize they can squeeze more juice out of each teacher by assigning 50 "virtual students." There is the added distraction of having your family around. 
    When tutoring people online I often had to mute the audio to yell at everyone in my house to shut up. 
    These are valid concerns but I want to draw attention to the problem with learning from home in general for students that are involved and trying to learn. 
</p><p> 
    To make my point clear, what classes can be moved online? Can gym class be moved online? No, of course not. My concern isn't that you can't 
    physically exercise in your house. You can follow an exercise program in your living room, but you really shouldn't! Whether or not a student is committed to learning the problem with distance learning is that people are doing it from home. From a place they now inhabit 24/7. 

</p><p> 
    Why is distance learning in your home a bad idea? Well, it's obvious if you think about the ancient technique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" style="color: green">the memory palace</a>. The memory palace leverages the human mind's 
    excellent ability to remember a physical space. We use this ability in everyday life. When we lose something we retrace our steps to remind ourselves where we left something. When we enter 
    a room we can suddenly remember things we were supposed to do or grab. The space we inhabit stores some of our memories. 
</p><p> 
    When I'm on vacation I can sleep easier than when I'm in my room. This is because my room reminds me of all the stuff I have to do, keeping me awake all night. If your thoughts keep you up at night sleep 
    somewhere you aren't storing memories. 
</p><p> 
    Using your house and room for too many things blurs and blends the memories together. Having a separate physical space to exercise in, like a gym, or a place to learn, like a classroom, helps trigger a certain mindset. When the home is used for too many things all meanings blend together and nothing 
    acheives its optimal potential. If you doubt that our environment affects our thinking try reading a newspaper in a crowd at a concert. Go to the gym or park to exercise. Go to the library or classroom to learn.
