<h1>A World Not Made For Us (1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p style="background-color:pink;"><i>This is part of a series on space colonization that I'll be uploading out of order. Once they're complete I'll rearrange them.</i></p>
<h3>Why bother?</h3>

<p> 
This world was not made for us. The majority of the Earth's surface is covered in undrinkable water. The southern continent of Antartica is completely inhospitable to human life. The deserts are expanding. Mosquitos kill one million people every year. Most of the world is inhospitable to us in some way. It is only by our own cleverness that we have been able to adapt to the diverse ecosystems across the planet. 
</p><p> 
We wear clothes to maintain our body heat. Chemical fertilizers are added to fields to increase our food supply. Lightbulbs keep us seeing after the sun goes down. Electricity, almost nonexistent in nature outside of thunderstorms, is produced in ever greater quantities. It is undeniable that the majority of humans now exist in artificial environments. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. If we can learn to tread gently on this planet our reign as Life's apex predator may be long.
</p><p> 
As inhospitable as much of the Earth is to human life, every piece of it is still more livable than anything off world. This is the only home we have, or will have, for the foreseeable future. We may dream of changing other worlds in Gaia's image for our own sakes but this misses what we are. We have our modest cultural adaptations: clothes, agriculture, electricity, etc..., which suffice on Earth. If we aren't too reflective on our nature it may appear that we can keep extending these cultural adaptations. That we can cover ourselves with bigger t-shirts and add more ammonia to the soil to adapt to off-world environments. 
</p><p> 
I have to ask, where is the limit to this? To some extent we are like water. We can take the shape of the glass we're put in. Yet water still has fundamental properties and is not infinitely transformable. Water is incompressible, it freezes and boils easily. Like us water has properties all its own. Water can be found in three states on Earth: solid, liquid, gaseous. If you want to imagine putting humanity off world think about what happens to water in the imagined environment. On Mars it's all frozen. We are 70% percent water with none of that percentage existing as a solid.
</p><p> 
I love space exploration. I am as awestruck as anyone else when viewing the images taken by the Hubble space telescope. The Pilars of Creation really look like a star forge made by God. And when we contemplate the immensity of the planets in our solar system it's easy to see why they were names after the gods. 
</p><p> 
I want to know more about the universe I live in. If given the chance I'd take the Faustian bargain one step further. Faust asked for all worldly knowledge. I'd ask for all cosmic knowledge. Yet as fascinating and beautiful as the night sky is, I know that it was not made for me. The Earth itself was not made for me but rather the other way around. I am like the mud or the mountain which are shaped by the vagaries of weather. 
</p><p> 
Our current existence on the planet is possibly be a fluke. For all the violence humanity has inflicted on itself nothing comes as close to total annihilation our ancestors experienced. There isn't as much genetic variation in humans as you'd expect. This suggests that we went through a genetic bottle neck at some point, with estimates as low as 2,000 humans at some point. That would have put us in the category of <i>Critically Endangered</i>. There may have been more people but they didn't give us any of their genes. In terms of cutting it close this was an edge that could split hairs. It was probably pure luck we survived this bottle neck. If we could go back in time and run the clock again there isn't any guarantee that we'd come out on top. All the other species of human no longer exist. How the other humans disappeared isn't known. We, homo sapiens, may have taken them out, or it may have been nature. Either case is instructive to our future. 
</p><p> 
One of the purported benefits of space colonization is to help humanity survive an existential risk. A event so climatic that it would wipe out all human life, or enough of it that civilization never recovers. Let's walk through the logic of what can be called the Plan B argument for space colonization. There are two cases here to consider. The one is where the colonies off-world will be large and self sufficient or at least have the capacity to be self sufficient. By self sufficient I mean that they could continue functioning without hinderance if cut off from Earth for the duration of a cataclysm. The other case is one where the colonies would fall apart without support from Earth.
</p><p> 
These off-world colonies could be giant space stations orbiting the sun or underground bunkers on Mars. The possibility of a colony outside of our solar system is so far ahead that the technological landscape can't be commented on here. The exact details aren't important for the moment. I just want to point out a few things about the Plan B argument. In the long term Plan B advocates will want self sufficient colonies. In the short term all we will have are the colonies that will rely on Earth's resources. Let's give the Plan B'ers the benefit of the doubt and say there is a large off-world self sufficient colony or group of colonies. 
</p><p> 
The prototypical argument for a Plan B colony is to recover after something like an asteroid hits the Earth. To avoid the fate of the dinosaurs. If an asteroid strikes and wipes out all or almost all humans the colonists will wait it out. Eventually after the Earth is close to habitable again the colonists will repopulate the Earth. How long will they wait? After the Chicxulub impactor hit Earth a it took out the dinosaurs it took life at least 30,000 years to recover. The colonists may be able to speed things up a bit if they were able to reintroduce lost species to Earth. Still the scales of time we're talking here are enormous. Many generations will come and go off-world before Earth returns to Eden. Whose to say colonists would want to repopulate Earth?  
</p><p> 
The group of colonists to do this job should be large enough to avoid genetic problems and maintain a reasonable standard of living. A source of wealth is specialization. The larger the group of people, the more specialists exist, the wealthier the community. A small colony of stewards safeguarding frozen fetuses on the moon is not enough. For a Plan B to work you're going to need something that can wait out for the long haul. 
</p><p> 
The plan B argument doesn't hinge on repopulating Earth. The point is that humanity survives. How long can humans remain the same species when the environment becomes as artificial as a space colonist's would be. Our genes are plastic to the environment we're in. Through a combination of genetic drift, sexual selection, and a radically different environment humans will no longer be human. This may be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view. It is not clear if this is the fate of our species either way. In the long run we don't change and die or we change and still die. Focusing on the inevitable end to humanity isn't helpful. Anymore helpful than deciding to kill your self right now because your own death is inevitable. 
</p><p> 
Let's talk about death for a second. My own interest in writing about space colonization started after thinking about a reoccurring nightmare I've had for the last decade. Dreams can seem more real than life sometimes. It would not surprise me to die in my current life and wake up to find that I had dreamt it all. That everything that I'm experiencing right now seems more real than waking life. This is just a thought. 
</p><p> 
I don't know if you can relate to dreams that are more vivid than life. A few years ago I had an MRI done and the doctor found a cyst on my pineal gland which may explain why my dreams feel so intense, so real. The pineal gland produces melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep patterns. A pineal cyst is not uncommon. More than 1 in 50 people have one. I have to wonder though if they affect our sleep. 
</p><p> 
In my reoccurring dream I saw people trying to leave a dying world. When they left they went into an abyss of blackness. Some made it to other worlds but eventually these were exhausted too. Again they people left. Everyone was eventually swallowed into an oblivion by the blackness. 
</p><p> 
We've all had more terrifying nightmares than this. What bothered me was its reoccurrence. I thought trying to understand it would help and it has. Clearly the blackness is the death, the annihilation, the place from which everything came and where it all goes back to. 		Most of us deal with our fear of death by producing something that we believe will outlive us. Children are the obvious example. Others make houses, create music, write stories. Necessity is said to be the mother of invention. I believe fear of death is the father of creation. A fear that doesn't give birth itself but impregnates the mind. Writing let's my mind give birth. 
</p><p> 
We can step back from the short duration of our lives and look at our creations as a thread of continuity of ourselves. Keep stepping back. Go far enough and you'll see that everything is heading for the void. In 7.5 billion years the Sun will expand past Earth's orbit. Swallowing it and destroying everything we've ever known. Things will fall apart well before that of course but the Sun swallowing the Earth is the most vivid example of the slate being wiped clean. If something of humanity survives this, a descendent or creation of humanity, this too will face eventual annihilation. 
</p><p> 
I am not saying that we should all give up doing anything because death is inevitable. I am trying to make the opposite point, that life is rare and precious because death is the only constant. When thinking about Plan B arguments for space colonization we need to be mature in our understanding of an eventual annihilation. Seeing it without jumping to the conclusions of completely giving up or doing everything humanly possible to continue. Both conclusions are a submission of the mind to fear.  
</p><p> 
I have faith that space agencies around the world can catalogue most of the asteroids that could potentially collide with Earth. The actual danger that we'll go out like the dinosaurs is low. I have no faith in humanity's ability to avoid something like a nuclear holocaust. We've had these weapons for barely 80 years. Ask yourself what would happen if we went back in time and gave nuclear bombs to Suleiman the Magnificent, Genghis Khan, or to Justinian the Great. How long do you think it would take before they used them? How many continents would be uninhabitable?
</p><p> 
They were human and we are human. The only difference between rulers of the past and modern politicians are the clothes they wear. Their behavior is determined by the incentives of their time. Nuclear armed terrorist could destroy a nation but probably wouldn't be able to end civilization. Unless of course, the a nuclear armed nation is run by terrorists. Climate change is seen as the possible end to humanity. It isn't. Climate change will kill a lot of us and impoverish us but not kill all of us. It may lead to nuclear Armageddon as the world's superpowers fight for dwindling resources. Climate change may end civilization but it is unlikely to end humanity. Nuclear weapons though very well could. 
</p><p> 
Would an off world colony be enough to save us from nuclear Armageddon? Even at the peak of the nuclear arms race there weren't enough weapons to make humanity extinct directly. Most people would die from the bombs percussive force and radiation. The real annihilator would be the knock on effects. Enough dust would be kicked up into the air to blot out the sun for about a decade. No new crops. No warmth. Total famine. An off-world colony with surplus crops could save humanity from total famine. Then again it might just be smarter to invest all of our energies into avoiding this.  
</p><p> 
For a castastrophy that made Earth uninhabitable a few generations the off-world colonies might have trouble restarting human civilization on Earth. The industrial revolution depended on deposits of easily accessible fossil fuels. Those have all been depleted. If we lost all of our technology and needed to restart from the industrial revolution we simply wouldn't be able to. Assuming the colonists had the capacity to build renewable power plants then humanity would have a shot of rebuilding. Even being able to rebuild has a downside. It may act as a rational for going full on nuclear holocaust. Someone with their finger on the button may think "Well, this'll be bad but it won't wipe us out forever." Plan B could potentially backfire in this way. 
</p><p> 
There are other extinction level events that could conceivably be overcome with robust off-world colonies. If Plan B is the sole argument for space colonization then we might as well just build habitats on the ocean floor. We could avoid the costs of lifting things into orbit, the perpetual radiation of space, and you could have normal Earth gravity in the deep ocean. If you're worried about a lack of solar power in the ocean don't be. There are thermal vents that could be used for power or the ocean itself if you have access to fissile materials or a fusion reactor. The ocean acts as a giant heat sink. Most of the ways we produce electricity right now work by heating steam up and using the difference in temperature to make a turbine move. Plan B is warranted in very few scenarios and among these an underwater colony could do just as well. Avoiding extinction through off world habitats shouldn't be the main reason to do it. 
</p><p> 
Full scale separate colonies off-world are derided for bad reasons as well as good. I wanted to walk through two arguments against space colonization that I find interesting. The first is that humanity simply isn't good enough. That we shouldn't spread out into space when we can't even settle things here. No, if we had to be perfect or even good enough to do anything nothing would get done. The people who think this way also misunderstand what can precipitate growth. 
</p><p> 
I've met a few people who were total shitheads. People who were selfish and reckless but learned to shape up after having kids. Something about putting responsibility on people can make some of them grow up. This of course isn't true for everyone. The point is that you can't discount someone as not being good enough when it may be the case that shouldering a new responsibility may make them good enough. 
</p><p> 
Another common anti-space colonization reason is the cost. With everything that could be fixed here on Earth why bother moving people into space? This is true. We could use the money to fix potholes or donate mosquito nets. This argument is somewhat valid when we look at the costs to benefits of certain goals. 
</p><p> 
If humans are able to more cheaply mine asteroids in space then it seems apparent that doing so would be good. There are of course a lot of details to be worked out. Not just the technical ones but issues of commercializing space. We need a legal framework to proceed. Currently no nation can claim territory in space. This convention was conceived during the cold war. I believe the details will be worked out as we proceed. Laws don't stop avarice. The potential wealth will push forward new treaties and protocols for commercializing space. 
</p><p> 
The potential benefits are too great to ignore. It would be excellent for our environment if we could move most of our manufacturing into space. Taking the cost the environment currently bears from out current methods of production it seems obvious that harvesting and refining materials in space is a net positive. Though in reality it may not be for most people. 
</p><p> 
Here in the United States wealth inequality has been steadily growing for the last 30 years. As a whole the nation is wealthier but the typical citizen is no better off and is probably poorer when we take into account what actually makes life worth living. The major sources of meaning in a life are friends, family, religion, and work. You can't take away all of these things and expect people to be better off. We have facebook, pornography, and part time work but are lonelier, having less sex, and poorer. 
</p><p> 
The way the wealth that will be generated off world is spread on Earth matters a great deal. What's the point of making gold cheap enough to pave the roads with it if no one can afford a car? This is not a knock down argument but just something we have to be weary off. Extreme wealth inequality in any real democracy isn't stable. The problems associated with the new wealth in space aren't just about colonization. The same problems exist whether humans live and work off world or not. If we learn to deal with them we will be all the better off for it. 
</p><p> 
The desire to colonize space should be superseded by a desire to explore it. Exploration will have to come before any colonization efforts are made anyway. I am afraid that we may be so ignorant of things beyond Earth that we may inadvertently destroy very interesting scientific sites. There may exist on Mars or a moon of Jupiter some incomprehensible Rosetta stone like formation with details to our origins. Possibly details to our future. Prematurely colonizing other worlds may destroy opportunities for discovery that we are unaware of now. 
</p><p> 
This is not to say that I don't want manned research stations. Antartica has quite a few research stations and no colonies. These scientific stations give us some guide as to how we may proceed in space. By treaty no nation owns land in Antartica. The only reason to be on the continent is for non-commercial research. Something in the vein of the purely scientific research stations of Antartica would be amazing on other planets, moons, and in habitable satellites.
