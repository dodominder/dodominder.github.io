<h1>A Cabin In The Woods</h1>
<p>
Many friends of mine want to have a cabin in the woods. Somewhere they could vacation or live in. Far away and isolated from everything but the trees. I have also fantasized about a place of solitude like that. A place where loneliness is a choice. Though I don't understand why. I've read old books and come across this same wish. To own a house in the country. A place of almost complete solitude.
</p><p>
I do not know where this desire comes from. It is related to but different from the fantasy of self sufficiency. A dream that many doomsday preppers have as they get ready for Armageddon. Those people who store guns, seeds, gold, and five years worth of caned food. No, the cabin in the woods fantasy is much different. Though it shares the theme of I need to get away from other people.
</p><p>
In New York city you can walk down the street naked and everyone will ignore you. So in a big city it's easy to be lonely, to find solitude, to escape from other people if that is the goal. You cannot escape the artificial noises though. The beeps and rumbling of cars. The perpetual alarms of an ambulance spread throughout a large city. The neighbors who scream at each other over nothing. There is also the noxious air, trash, and crime; all things that are nice to avoid.
</p><p>
Is it crime, pollution, and noise that inspire these fantasies? I think they definitely contribute. The larger thing I see as contributing is a lack of purpose. By this I mean not being able to see yourself fitting into it all. A city can feel at times like an organism. And if you aren't a part of that organism you can feel like an invader. Are you a tourist? A baker? A mom? A delivery man? A CFO? These positions orchestrate what kind of behavior you are to manifest. Lacking a place to be can make the cabin in the woods appealing.
</p><p>
Again that isn't the full story. Even having a role in the larger picture can be tiring. A cabin in the woods can be a place to get away from the normal dictates of life. A place small and simple enough for the mind to contain. It isn't a place I'd like to be right now but I have a foggy understanding of its appeal. The silence of such a place comes again to me to be the biggest appeal. During the day there isn't a consitently silent place anywhere in the city or suburbs. Even the libraries have forfeited silence.
</p><p>
Noises force themselves into your thinking much more easily than the other senses. For example, when you sleep your eyes turn off for a bit but your ears are always running, waiting for input. Flashing lights don't wake me up but people talking does. It can be difficult to complete a thought when someone next to you is continuously talking. To me this relative silence of the cabin in the woods is the most appealing. Silence is the membrane of reflection. The mind needs silence to form a coherent image in the same way a pond needs calmness to form a good reflection.
