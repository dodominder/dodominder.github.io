<h1>Did the progenitor of blue eyes have brown eyes?</h1>
<p>
Was the first blue eyed person the first person to evolve the genes for blue eyes?
</p><p>


My understanding of genetics is stuck at a high school level. I know that the blue eyed gene is recessive and that it has only evolved once in humans. Every human with blue eyes is believed to have the same mutation for this trait.1 This is in contrast to other traits that converged to a similar effect by different mutations. For example, the genes that allow adult humans to drink milk are different around the old world.2

 Since it is recessive I have to wonder if the first person to have the mutation that causes blue eyes had brown eyes. It is more likely that one mutation occurred and was kept recessive than that person spontaneously had blue eyes. So how many generations removed from their progenitor was the first blue eyed person? Assuming there wasn't outright incest and that the gene came into existence among tribals I think its safe to assume blue eyed people started popping up in the 3rd generation after the gene's creation. It's conceivable that multiple blue eyed people began popping up amongst the same population at the same time. Instead of going from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 blue eyed people, it might have started out with 6 to 6 to 12 to 12 etc...

Big disclaimer: I am not a biologist or a geneticist. My understanding of genes is extremely limited. Everyone in my family except my dad and I has blue eyes. It is just interesting to think that a single mutation propagated itself the way it did. What is also interesting to ask is if there are any phenotypic differences in the people who are heterozygous? Those who carry the genes for blue eyes recessively. Genes rarely act on a single trait. What phenotypic differences are there for recessive carriers of the trait? For example, could carrying the blue eyed gene recessively make your ears longer? I don't think it does but I'm just wondering if it has any effect. I suppose you'd need to examine about 1000 people to get any meaningful answer to that question.
