<h1>Mind Reading Devices</h1>
<p>
	There have been a number of devices coming on the market lately that claim to read minds. Most of them do this by reading the electrical activity of the brain. This idea is straight forward and simple enough. Monitor the electrical patterns the brain produces and assign action to each pattern. I saw one of these devices in person. It was a headpiece with electrodes connected to a quadcopter. A guy was piloting the quadcopter with his head. I asked him how it worked and he said “brain waves.” I asked him what a brain wave is and he said “It’s a wave the brain makes.” For some reason I don’t believe he understood how his mind-reading-device worked.
</p><p>
	From what I can tell these devices work like a heart monitor. In a heart monitor electrodes make contact with the body and record the electrical activity of the pumping heart. The oscillations of the heart, of course, produce a wave. Most mind reading devices can probably be connected to heart rate monitors, though they wouldn’t be as functional. It’s easy to imagine something like a building’s thermostat connected to an electrode on the chest that records your pulse. This would be nice to turn down the temperature when you have to run around. 
	</p><p>
	This type of technology appears in the news every couple of months because it has allowed paralyzed people to control robotic limbs. It must be noted though that to use this technology the person must train with it. For someone without the use of their limbs it makes sense to train on a brain-wave device. But what about everyone else?
	</p><p>
	It’s not clear to me that these devices should be called “mind reading devices” in so far as they only record the electrical activity of the brain. This is a form of mind reading no doubt. Still it must be acknowledged that the human using the device has to change their thoughts to learn to use the device. If your brain is hooked up to a robotic arm and you think “lift the can on the table” and the robotic arm does so then yes, this really is mind reading.
	</p><p>
	This is not the technology as I see it now. As of now it appears that the user has to train the way they think to produce suitable signals for the mind-reading-connected device. This entails training the human on the so called “mind reading” device. It’s like saying my computer understands human commands. It does to an extent but if I want the computer to actually do anything I have to be trained to use it. Each of us that is using any kind of electronic device has had some form of formal/informal training.
	</p><p>
	The electrode approach to mind reading seems like a chair without legs. You can sit on it but you have to get on the ground. As long as we acknowledge what the technology could potentially do to us I see no problem with it. I kind of like the technology as it exists today. My fear comes from the unreflective extension of this way of mind reading. If we covered our scalps in electrodes we would not be able to “read thoughts.” We could continually recognize more complex patterns but not straight out mind read. By reading the patterns produced by your brain a machine can tell when you’re asleep but I can also tell when you’re asleep by looking at you. These types of machines aren’t peering into the mind any more than we can when reading someone’s face. 
	</p><p>
	A danger lies in this technology. The danger is that people may train themselves down to the level of the machine and they may become so good at it that other people think the machine really is peering into the mind. No. The machine never sees into the mind. The mind has trained itself to speak to the machine but the full content of the brain is still hidden. This is the same danger that the polygraph produced. The polygraph is not admissible in court. The polygraph can’t tell when someone’s lying. Still people put faith in it. People believe what they want to be true. And they want a lie detector and a mind reading machine to be real.
	</p><p>
	Another trouble with the very concept of mind reading comes to mind. To explain this I want to refer to the X-Men movies. In the movies Professor Xavier wears a helmet connected to a device, called Cerebro, and scans the minds of billions of people at once. In the movie mind reading is depicted as hearing the internal monologue that goes through a person’s head. Yet for each person we only hear one monologue. If you pay attention to your own thoughts you’ll quickly notice thoughts arising from nowhere. Listen in on a mind and I suspect it would sound like a conversation, not a solitary monologue. How often do you talk to yourself in your mind? Who are you talking to? If there is a solitary point of conscious in the mind then there would be no need to speak to yourself.
	</p><p>
	The mind is a bundle of smaller simpler minds and those simpler ones are still bundles of even simpler ones. When we feel “two minds” about something we really may have two minds in conflict, either of which may arise to take the seat of conscious thought. If you could read someone else’s mind you would hear a conversation, not a monologue. So how can we expect a machine, at the technical level of a polygraph, to parse out which voice in the conversation is you? They are all of you. Part of you may be telling the truth, the other part may be lying. Both are 100% you.
</p><p>
	All that complaining about our common misconceptions aside I am excited to see the continued evolution of electrode connected mind reading devices. There exists no danger of abuse as long as we recognize the out-of-many-comes-one principal of the human mind.
