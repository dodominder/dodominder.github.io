  Adding anything to this blog has become difficult recently because I'm just not a good writer. I can't even read my old stuff because I want to totally rewrite it or trash it which doesn't really do any good. Practice is difficult when you know your stuff's no good. Practice is difficult when you don't know anything and are stuck to writing about yourself. Is that most writers? I don't think so. Despite my lack of talent I'll keep practicing and plan to resume my habit of a short weekly blog piece. Today I wanted to bring up something that I've learned and just felt viscerally.

I found my old iPhone from the summer of 2012. That summer had been spent in work and despair. A despair that I tried very hard to hide but constantly seeped through my pores, sweating melancholy. The phone was only used for a couple of months and then left untouched in a drawer until today in 2018. iPhones were overpriced and I only bought one that summer because I had made a lot of money and thought an expensive gadget would cheer me up. It didn't! The phone had around 500 photos. Going through it I remembered what it was like that summer! Pure unending misery. I was so deeply depressed. Even though I made $20 an hour without a college degree. Even though I went on a few dates. Even though I was 45 pounds lighter and had more hair. I wouldn't want to trade places with that guy!

How many people's lives were defined by a series of mistakes? How many live rut to rut? I don't know. Finding these old photos made me miss my friends, who I got to see a lot six years ago, but not anything else from that time. I remembering vividly the feeling of being a lady bug on the end of a stick that was being oscillated. The constant work. The string of disappointments. Ha!

It turned out to not be a complete waste of time. The bouts of inability to sleep or eat turned me to deeper reading in philosophy, when I had the energy to read. Within the black cave of despair a lovely flower bloomed for philosophy. The love of wisdom. The framing of frames. Answers, alternatives, and approaches to the things in life that actually seemed to matter. The pain of that summer helped me understand Frankenstein. Made me know what Frankenstein's Robert Walton meant when he said that his failing arctic expedition required all of his philosophy! That summer turned out not to be a waste since I know to watch where I walk so as to avoid slipping down the deepest well, despair.
