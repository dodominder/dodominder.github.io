<h1>Storyline</h1>
<p>
What exactly is a storyline? Is it just another word for plot? A less childish word for story? Am I the only one who thinks the word is dumb? Every time I hear those two words pasted together in a sentence I wince. I don’t understand the world. If you like the way a sequence of events is done in a film, book, or video game then say “plot.” If you like the characters, the world, and the plot then say that you liked the “story.” Where exactly is the line in storyline being drawn? The line in storyline isn’t affirming that the plot follows in a straight path. Nor does the line refer to the thing that bounds the story.
</p><p>
 Lines bound space but the line in storyline isn’t there to bound narrative space. The word is most often used to describe the situation, the setup of the story, the hook. This is commonly known as the logline, the central conflict of the story. There is no particular type of story that has monopolized the word storyline. So why use it? A lazy portmanteau like splot (story and plot) doesn’t offend the ear as much as storyline. Perhaps the line in storyline is borrowed from logline. This hasn’t been borne out from a cursory search but it would give some reason to give more respect to the dumb word.
</p><p>
The only reason I see storyline as being more readily on the tongue of people who talk about stories they like is that the word story seems childish. Today in parts of Canada an adult could get mocked for talking about visiting the “forest” because of the childish connotations the term carries. The forest is where fairytales take place. To the Canadian’s credit I haven’t heard them replace forest with forestline. That’s just it though, if you don’t like the word story (I do) then just say plot or invent some new word. Don’t try to shove lines into the magnanimous word, story.
</p><p>
A word is a tag to a concept. Adding the word line to story is adding a discount tag in my opinion. My initial reaction to the word storyline is that people have been using it to sound more serious in their speech when talking about stories. On the other hand the word could be in wide use because it may sound less hoity-toity than logline or central conflict or setup or plot. Still both cases can be ignored and we could all just say story.
</p><p>
Whether on streets, fields, or accounting sheets, lines denote barriers. Does the line in storyline denote some type of barrier? No. The line in the word story line does no hard work. It doesn’t bound, direct, or denote the type of flow a narrative has. The craft of story is one that is filled with barriers and bounds. All kinds of bounds and guidelines (lines here is a good suffix!) such as the three act structure we all learn in English class. Even the stories we tell our friends have bounds: Tell something interesting, no one cares if you went to buy bread and nothing happened on the way. Leave storyline to the ash heap of ill-conceived words. Use story to describe story because it is a perfectly fine word.
