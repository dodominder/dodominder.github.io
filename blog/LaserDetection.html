<h1>Laser Detection</h1>
<p>
	I have a laser pointer and thought it'd be fun to build a laser detection system. The system I made isn't practical. My system uses a single red laser that bounces around a series of mirrors and back to a sensor that rings an alarm if it doesn't receive input. So if someone walks through the beam, the alarm is triggered! The project is basically done and works well enough, though if I were to build this thing for actual use I'd use the buzzer from an old alarm clock instead of the tiny buzzer I used when building the thing. The Arduino could also be replaced with a potentiometer and relay. Also, instead of a red laser the whole thing would be more invisible if an infrared laser was used.

The Arduino gets input from a photo-resistor and sends electricity out to the alarm if the sensor doesn't get enough light. In the pictures the alarm is a green LED but a buzzer could be swapped with it just as easily. The amount of light needed for the sensor was determined by graphing the resistor's input from sunlight against laser light.

At first I was concerned that sun light would overwhelm the sensor but this turned out not to be the case. As long as the sensor wasn't pointing directly at the sun. Before building this thing I thought I'd have to use a polarizing lens or something to block sunlight. Thankfully you can get away with just pointing the sensor sideways. Even in full day light the alarm doesn't register the sun light as the laser light unless pointed directly at the sun!

Another concern I had was the potential loss of energy from the distance covered by the laser and the loss of energy from refracting/reflecting by glass mirrors. This is negligible but the angle of the mirror isn't.

The graphs were created with <a href="https://processing.org/"> Processing</a>. Directions for getting this kind of sensor input can be found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Serial-Data-Plotter/">here</a>. The code for turning on the alarm is incredibly simple. It's a modified version of the Arduino code <a href="http://www.theorycircuit.com/arduino-serial-data-plotter/">here</a>. I just added an if statement: "If the sensor is below a certain value the alarm turns on."

To repeat, this thing should be conceivable without an Arduino. Using a relay that is in the off position when the sensor gets light. A potentiometer should be paired with the resistor to get the 'just right' amount of resistance. When the resistor fails to get light the relay goes on and powers an alarm. I don't see the point in building the thing. I won't get any money for it and I'll waste my valuable time on something that I'm 95% sure will work. But if you decide to build a laser detection system: Don't, lasers hurt eyes.
