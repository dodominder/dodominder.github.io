<h1>Elephant Dice</h1>
<p>
	There are 8 dice sitting on my table. One's big and red, it's from a casino. Some of the others are for Dungeons and Dragons. There is a six sided die that is off white. It looks and feels old. My grandfather bought it at an antique shop and tells me that it's made of ivory. I have no idea if this is true. I know they used to use ivory for everything, billiard balls, combs, piano keys, etc... I know ivory has become illegal to harvest but I don't know if it illegal to buy and sell. I'd imagine so.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't really matter if the die in front of me is real ivory. Hopefully it's not but I don't have anything riding on it being made of elephant tusks. The real issue I have is knowing whether or not my grandfather was lying about it being made of ivory. He lies about all kinds of knick-knacks like this. He'd go to a flea market, buy some 80 year old photo album and claim that everyone in it is a  relative of his.
</p>
<p>
He's not doing this for a laugh. I honestly can't figure out why he lies like this. What is there to gain? What is there to gain by saying that an old die is made of ivory? Nothing but an interesting story. I guess that's the only reason to buy it. He definitely bought the die at an antique shop. And I can't imagine an antique shop selling an old die if it wasn't made of something interesting.
</p>
<p>
Then again, it could have been part of some old monopoly set. It could have gotten loose and sat on a table of miscellaneous items. Someone could have picked it up and said "What's with the dice?" and a quick thinking salesman says "I think it's made of ivory." Now the die has something interesting about it. Now it is a lock-pick for conversation.
</p>
<p>
Maybe that's what my grandfather was buying. A totem for conversation. Maybe that's what antique stores sell: interesting things that get bought by boring people. That could be why my grandfather would lie so much about strange things. To be interesting. It's one thing if you're telling a joke and lie for comedic effect. But lies that make you seems more interesting are obnoxious.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of lies about your past. Lies to cover up something and lies to make you seems cooler. It's unclear to me which is more common. At times both come in pairs. Like a set of dice that can be bought at an antiques shop. That may or may not be made of ivory.
