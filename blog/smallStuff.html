<h1>Small Stuff Matters</h1>
<p>
Humans have no intuitive understanding of compound interest. We have rules of thumb to cope, like the rule of 72, but no intuition. This fact becomes clear if you ask yourself “What’s the difference between an initial $200 earning 5% a year versus 3% a year, compounded, for 100 years? The answer is ($26,300.25 - $3,843.73) = $22,456.52… That’s insane! And we have no intuition for that kind of thing. That small 2% difference magnifies to a huge difference of over $20,000.

The examples in finance are instructive because there exist calculators to figure these things out. We can easily calculate the final effect of small differences. Yet in the rest of life the problem is not so clear. You can probably point to a couple big events that defined your life but can’t do the same for all the little ones. All the tiny changes that had bigger effects. Consider how many calories someone eats each day. Imagine they eat just enough to maintain their current weight. Say 1,800 calories a day. If they ate 5.5% more calories a day (about a 100), they’d gain 10 pounds in one year. That’s adding an apple a day to gain 10 pounds a year. Of course you should still eat apples. This is just a crude calculation.
</p><p>
Take a lesson from this. Our intuition for small differences is nil. My examples so far deal with small differences that result in bigger outcomes over time. So time is the key thing here which fogs our intuition. Accept that your intuition for these things is bad. Once that is done we can start to try to understand the magnifying effects of time. 
</p><p>
Another example that I think is important is the question of IQ. It’s well known that the heritability of IQ goes up as people get older. Paradoxically though people are pretty similar in intelligence at birth. A tiny almost insignificant difference can magnify itself through time. This is why children all so similar at birth become so different after 40 years. The magnifying effects of time. If you’re a little disagreeable at birth you could swing to be the most disagreeable person on the planet. Or not. Because, unlike in finance, not all of these things are allowed to compound on themselves.

When we see a character flaw or admirable attribute in a person we shouldn’t assume it was always there. We should wonder if there was a tiny difference that compounded on itself beyond our intuition. Further we should look at everything that is gigantic and wonder what small difference caused it. Was there a pebble in the way of a drop of water that redirected where the grand canyon was going to form? Is obesity a problem of people eating 5% more calories than they need?
