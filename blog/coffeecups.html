<h1>What's the deal with coffee mugs?</h1>
<p>
  What's the deal with coffee mugs? Why are they in every gift shop, kitchen, and diner? It isn't just the popularity of coffee. The mugs are ostensibly for coffee but a café is the last place you'll find one. If you observed what people drink coffee out of on any day of the week you'd see it being downed mostly from paper or styrofoam cups. So how did the mug become synonymous with coffee or gift shops or diners?

The coffee mug might be too popular for people to notice how strange they are. My cabinet is filled with mugs of all shapes and sizes. If I own two glasses that match it is by accident... and that is strange. The plates, spoons, and bowls are pretty uniform while the mugs are an eclectic mess. The closest thing there is to a common coffee mug is a short, thick, beige cup with a handle. The kind of mug you'd find in any all night diner.

So why the proliferation of novelty mugs? There must have been a period of time before novelty mugs? Or did the novelty mug evolve alongside the standard mug? The mug makes a fine enough gift being that it's useful. It's just a strange thing to walk into someone's kitchen and see a collection, usually acquired over decades, of coffee mugs. Maybe the mugs have a longer life span than most other gifts. Towels, shirts, bottle openers, and knives all degrade over time in one way or another. The mighty coffee mug seems to hold out pretty well comparatively. Even when the awful joke painted on the side has been worn away the mug can still hold a hot liquid safely.

Coffee mugs, like Christmas sweaters, are allowed to be tacky. There is an art to the ugliness of the mug. Logos, bad jokes, locations adorn the sides of these things. Don't get me wrong! I like my coffee mugs. It's just that my taste in the style of mugs would never carry to my aesthetic sense for anything else. This makes me wonder if the ancient ceramic bowls and cups we find around the world would have been considered tacky in their respective times and places? Will my mugs be dug up one day by an archaeologist and put in a museum next to great works of art? One can hope.
