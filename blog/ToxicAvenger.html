<h1>The Toxic Avenger: The Greatest Superhero Film of All Time</h1>
<p>
The greatest superhero film ever made came out in 1984. It's box office was 160% of its budget. It spawned a line of toys, a cartoon, a couple bad sequels (and one good one). It was The Toxic Avenger! It is to my constant annoyance that this movie hasn't garnered the critical and mainstream praise that it deserves. It does have a cult following but that's not enough. It should be entered into the National Film Archive. Why does this film deserve more? Because it is simply better than most of the superhero films made in America over the past 40 years.
</p><p>
The whole concept of a superhero is silly and fun. Silly and fun is what we should see in our superhero films and this is what The Toxic Avenger dishes out minute by minute. Something many modern films, such as Batman V. Superman, fail to do at all. The Zach Snyder Superman films are boring and painful. The heroes are mopey and seemed dragged into being a hero. The marvel cinematic universe gets this campiness part right. The adventures are fun and ridiculous. Still they can take themselves too seriously at some moments. 
</p><p>
Captain America: Winter Soldier is an example of Marvel making a decent superhero film that lacks the levity seen in its other films. The Toxic Avenger walks this line perfectly. The humor and fun of a hulking radioactive hero is felt throughout the cheesy story. I felt more emotionally involved in the love between the blind woman and Toxie (the titular character) than any romance forced into the superhero films of the last 30 years. The Dark Knight has Batman's love interest die brutally. I felt nothing. The tenderness of love wasn't communicated in the Dark Knight because the whole movie took itself very seriously. It was too earnest.
</p><p>
Stan Lee himself acts as a narrator in the latest installment in the Toxic Avenger film universe. To my mind this proves that The Toxic Avenger is technically a marvel superhero and retroactively makes The Toxic Avenger the first entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. Stan Lee even helped Toxie get his own comic book, which is well deserved.
</p><p>
Toxie may have started out as a parody of the superheroes of the nuclear age but he rose from the nuclear waste that he was created in to become something more. Toxie is a genuinely heroic character. After being transformed into a hideous muscly monster Toxie gets right to work on stopping Nazis, rapists, and muggers. Better still he doesn't suffer any moral qualms about murdering people who are horribly evil (and all the villains in the film are horribly evil).
</p><p>
To speak strictly about narrative for a moment, it should be acknowledged that The Toxic Avenger does something most superhero films are horrible at. It works an origin story into the fabric of the lager narrative. The problem, narratively speaking, with a lot of superhero films is that they force an origin story where none is needed. This is boring. We all know how Superman got to Earth. And if I have to see Batman's parents get shot one more time I'm going to go back in time and shoot them myself. The Sam Raimi Spider Man movies get this right. The origin story has Spidey chase down the guy who shot his uncle which mirrors the showdown he has with the film's main villain, the Green Goblin.
</p><p>
My point about origin stories is that they should only be included if the general audience is totally unfamiliar with a character or if it serves some purpose in the story. If the audience is unfamiliar with the character then three minutes in the first act of the film are perfectly sufficient to explain the origin of a character. Origin stories in general are weird. Usually you get introduced to a character, learn to like them, and then get an origin story. It's like getting to know a person. You usually get their 'origin story' in bits and pieces as you get to know them as they are now.
</p><p>
The action in The Toxic Avenger is also better than most modern superhero films. It is better because you can tell what is happening. It lacks all the jump cuts and steady cam shots of The Avengers. All of Toxie's fights with the villains just feel like brutal justice. The movie never turns into a greenscreened-CGI nightmare of demon creatures from another dimension. There are no blue lasers in the sky or deadly gas or world ending stakes in The Toxic Avenger.
</p><p>
This is a bit of a side note but the overuse of CGI might be ruining otherwise fun movies. A clear example of the absurd use of CGI can be seen in the 2014 Ninja Turtles movie. It made the turtles look like giant hulking thugs. Compare it to the 1990 film where the turtles are just rubber costumes. There a physicality to the rubber costumes. Being "photorealistic" doesn't contribute to the suspension of disbelief as much as acting like a physical object does. It's like a video game with horrible graphics but great animation, it just feels more real. The take away for modern superhero films is that bigger isn't better. Destroying another CGI city, or the earth, or universe, won't make the audience care more.
</p><p>
Logan was a serious superhero film that just came out last year and was awesome. Wolverine spent the first 70% of that movie just trying to help Professor X. And when he learns to be a hero again at the end of the film it makes sense. He only saves a little over a dozen people but it feels larger than the second X-Men film, where the X-Men are trying to save all the mutants on the planet.
</p><p>
There's no secret formula to melding camp and seriousness in a superhero film. I'm tempted to say Logan and The Toxic Avenger take two different routes. Where the campy elements of Logan (Wolverine fighting a younger clone of himself) are played earnestly The Toxic Avenger does the opposite. All the criminals are serious bad guys: armed robbery, attempted rape, murder, etc. But the movie holds up that campy charm. That campy charm isn't easy to pull off either! Look at that horribly boring superhero film Kick-Ass. I can't remember a single scene from that movie. I do remember being bored out of my mind waiting for it to be over.
</p><p>
Boredom isn't an issue with The Toxic Avenger. It's a cult classic for a reason. Highly memorable and rewatchable. Check it out and check out the "real sequel" Citizen Toxie.
