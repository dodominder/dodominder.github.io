<h1>How Happy Is The Blameless Vassal's Lot</h1>
<p>
I have a fuzzy memory of what I was doing last summer, a fuzzier memory of the summer before that, and an even more murky memory of the summer before that. The farther out the memory the less pristine and coherent it is in my mind. The mind forgets much more than it remembers. For the most part this is good. It might be a burden to remember perfectly every detail of your life. The past would grow in mass and weigh down your head to immobility.
</p><p>
The important things are what is mostly remembered. So I have to wonder what is mostly important. All around me I see every aspect of life being recorded and archived. By the government, by industry, by legions of families on their social media profiles. Everything that can be digitally recorded is being digitally recorded. I have no problem with record keeping. I just think we should record what is important. The problem is who is to say what’s worth recording?
</p><p>
Some of the miscellaneous recordings of the ancients proved to be the most interesting. So I grant that it is impossible to know exactly what is worth recording. That concession doesn’t convince me that everything is worth recording though. Sometimes things are worth forgetting, sometimes not. Knowing the difference between the two is the challenge.
</p><p>
Everything turns to sand in the dessert of time. The rain will wash away every monument. The sun will swallow every clay tablet left in the desserts. In the time before that great blanking though do we not have a right to be forgotten? To let our names wash away like we had traced them on the beach? I think so. There are many people who seem to be chasing a sudo-immortality through digital archiving. While I sympathize with them on the one hand I have to wonder if what the ethereal immortality they chase is replacing what is real.
</p><p>
It’s a common site to see a gang of girlfriends at a bar spending half their time broadcasting what they’re doing. Taking more photos of themselves drinking then there are blades of grass in Scotland. God forbid we lived in the moment instead of living to capture the moment. All this is not to say that picture taking or any of that is bad. I just think there’s a point at which enough is enough. Not everything deserves to be capture and many times we disturb the thing we want to capture in the process of recording.
</p><p>
Extremely thankful am I that I was not born in 2005. Had I been born then, every moment of my life, every horribly awkward moment would have been posted in the digital archive. I suspect that kids growing up today will have a harder time reinventing themselves. They will be a bit weighted down by a past which has been recorded with a near perfect fidelity.
</p><p>
The problem stands: What is worth remembering? There are many cut and dry things worth remembering. I suppose we have to ask who we are recording for in the long term, undoubtedly impossible to know. Still I’d wager there’s things everyone wants to forget or let be forgotten. That ability to forget is also the ability to see things anew, to see the beauty of the fresh laid snow.
