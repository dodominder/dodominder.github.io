<h1>A Short Note On Investing For Retirement</h1>
<p>
There is a plethora of advice on where to invest money for retirement. Much of this advice is useless because it is too difficult to follow or down right pernicious. I've heard many older people talk about their investments as though they were a professional day trader. Most of their short term investments aren't much better than gambling. Investing and saving should be long term projects. While I have very strong opinions on where to invest money I do not want to add to that noise of investment advise. Instead I want to offer an equation for thought.
</p><p>


Humans are creatures of habit. I start each day with toast and coffee before work. Toast and coffee are probably things I would continue having each morning even if I lost my job just out of habit. The point is that many things in our lives are like morning toast and coffee. When I eventually transition from working full time to retirement I expect to continue many of my costly habits, such as eating, using electricity, etc. A way of preparing for that cost once my income stops is to consider how long I'll live after retirement and what percentage of my working salary I expect to live off of. 
</p><p>


Given the statistics I expect to live to about 78. As a cushion I'll say 81. If I retire by age 64 that gives me 17 years to live off of my savings. My assumption in all of this is that at bare minimum the money being invested for retirement has kept up with inflation. I do not expect to do much better than that given my country's demographics. Another assumption is that by 65 I can live off of half my working salary being that most of my fixed costs should be paid off by then i.e. housing, clothes. Half isn't a terrible number to shoot for. It's not great but not terrible.

</p><p>

Given these assumptions I offer the following.
</p><p>
Percentage of Income To Save for Investments Each Year = Y <br />
Years Spent Working = G <br />
Years Spent in Retirement before Death = H <br />
Y = H / (2*G)<br />
</p>
<p>


Simple. Since a good portion of your income is being saved, once you start living off of savings it should be a bit more than half of what was being consumed annually as opposed to invested. Simple investment advice that is perhaps too scary to abide. If you plug in the numbers you may find that you need to save 30% or more of your income! Untenable! Yeah it probably is, still, not a terrible goal to shoot for as long as the crappy nursing home your family puts you in is nice. Good luck and remember to read every investment book you can get your hands on. The bad ones are educational in their own way.
